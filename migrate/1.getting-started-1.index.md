This module is a **clone** of the [NuxtLabs UI](https://ui.nuxtlabs.com) module, migrated and altered to work with UnoCSS instead of TailwindCSS. The goal is to provide everything the original UI has to offer when building a Nuxt app while also using UnoCSS. This includes components, icons, colors, dark mode but also keyboard shortcuts.  This clone will be actively maintained and updated to keep up with the original [UI module](https://ui.nuxtlabs.com).

- Built with [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
